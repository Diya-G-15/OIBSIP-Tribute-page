                    Radha, has been an inspiration to countless devotees around the world. His unwavering devotion,

                <h2>Maharaj Ji's teachings to find prem</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>See our god in all.</li>

                <p><b>Pursuit of Eternal Happiness or Eternal Bliss:</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since immemorial time, every human being has sought to be "Happy". However due to our inherent
                    ignorance we look for this happiness in people, things and places. The material world which is full
                    of sorrow and suffering is incapable of quenching this inborn thirst for peace and happiness.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दुःखालयमशाश्वतम् ।
                    नाप्नुवन्ति महात्मानः संसिद्धिं परमां गताः ।।
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Few amongst us, realize this and proceed to seek happiness through God or Brahm. Even fewer actually
                    succeed in Self Realization or attaining Brahmanand. However there lies an even higher realm of
                    "Eternal Bliss" and "Everlasting Joy" which is attained only through the Divine Grace of Shri
                    PriyaPriyatam. This is the state of PREMANAND or Divine Love for our Yugal Sarkar where all forms of
                    Self Realization or Brahmanand fade in its comparison.</p>
