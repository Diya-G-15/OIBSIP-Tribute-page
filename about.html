                <h2>Premanand Ji's thought...</h2>
                <p>After reading so many books and mantras about god, the universe and devotion
                    ,something changed in the 10-year-old boy. Maharaj ji started to raise questions
                    on the purpose of life in childhood.
                    He used to wonder whether love of parents is permanent or temporary. and
                    if it is not permanent , then why is there so much attachment and dependence?
                    Furthermore, he also thought about whether the education that is taught
                    in the school can help him achieve his goal.
                    Why god has given him the birth!!!
                    What is the target of this human life and many more questions...
                </p>
                <p>By the time he was in class 9th he had strongly decided to lead a spiritual life exploring the path
                    leading towards God. He was prepared to leave his family for this noble purpose. He informed his
                    mother about his ideas and decision. At the young age of thirteen, one early morning at 3am Maharaj
                    Ji left his home to unveil the truth behind human life.</p>
                <p>As a spiritual seeker, most of his life was spent on the banks of river Ganges because Maharaj Ji
                    never accepted the hierarchical life of an Ashram. Very soon Ganges became a second mother to him.
                    He roamed on the Ghats of Ganges (Assi-Ghat and others between Haridwar and Varanasi) without caring
                    about hunger, clothes or weather. Even in the harshest winter he never stopped his daily routine of
                    taking bath thrice in Ganges. He used to fast without food for days and his body would shiver from
                    the cold but he stayed completely absorbed in meditation of "The Ultimate".
                    Within few years of Sanyaas he was duly blessed by Lord Shiva.
                </p>
                <p>Maharaj Ji was undoubtedly blessed by Lord Shiva, the epitome of knowledge and mercy. However he
                    continued to strive for a higher purpose. One day while meditating under a tree in Banaras, by the
                    sheer Grace of Shri ShyamaShyam he was drawn to the glory of Vrindavan.</p>
                <p>
                    The profound impact of Shri PremAnand Ji Maharaj's teachings is evident in the transformation of
                    numerous lives. His presence radiates divine energy, bringing hope, joy, and peace to those who come
                    in contact with him. He has truly become a guiding light for many on their spiritual path, leading
                    them closer to Goddess Shri Radha and helping them realize the purpose of life.
